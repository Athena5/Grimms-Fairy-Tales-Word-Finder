# Grimms-Fairy-Tales-Word-Finder
Python code that reads in file containing Grimm Brothers's Tales text and then find lines from each story that contains words entered into console. Certain stopwords cannot be queried, and there are certain words that allow for more complex queries when used in the correct format. Works best if run in Python IDLE.
